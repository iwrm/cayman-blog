The aim of the IWRM project is to improve the well-being of people by means of promoting coordinated, equitable and sustainable development and management of water, land and related resources.
In Bangladesh the enabling environment for inducing the paradigm shift from sectoral management of water resources to holistic and integrated management of water resources has been created by the enactment of the Bangladesh Water Act (BWA), 2013.
The IWRM project has two complimentary sub-components; the national component and the subnational component. The former is being implemented by a govt. department under the Ministry of Water Resources, Water Resources Planning Organisation (WARPO), and the sub-national component is being implemented by Swiss Red Cross and Dascoh. The national component’s focus is to further develop the regulatory framework and operationalize institutional mechanisms foreseen in the BWA, 2013. The sub-national component, on the other hand, intends to achieve the following:
# Bring about changes in role, practice and attitudes of water related asset owners and users through design and subsequent application of an incentive based regulatory system
# Enable different actors to understand and practice the principle of subsidiarity related to IWRM. The will mean that stronger regulatory role of local government institutions (Union Parishads and Pourashavas) who will be supported to develop, enact, and implement their own by-laws on water management issues
# Ensure citizen and LGI adherence to reducing over-abstraction and water pollution, reusing water (conjunctive use); recycling (waste) water; and restoring water safety (also referred to as 4 Rs).
# Accord primacy to asset owners’ technology choice with regard to water related assets respective the given regulatory framework.
# Support the strengthening of sub-national institutional mechanisms and further support citizens’ engagement in IWRM governance
Integrated Water Resource Management in the Barind tract

A novelty for Bangladesh, this project will bring the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management to the sub-district and community level. Poverty in the Barind tracts is higher than national average and water scarcity uncovers economic, ecological and equity issues. Elected local governments will be capacitated to regulate water use and increase availability of water for the benefit of about a million people in the target region.
